    "The Ising model was proposed by Wilhelm Lenz who gave it as a problem to his graduate student Ernst Ising, after whom this model is named. The 1-D model was solved by Ising in his 1924 thesis. Later, in 1944 Lars Onsager solved the 2-D model with the transfer matrix approach$^\\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model/}{ [Wikipedia]}$.  It is powerful in modelling many thermodynamical phenomena and in explaining phase transitions and universality$^\\href{https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-cartoon-picture-of-magnets-that-has-transformed-science-20200624/}{ [Q]}$."
