    "The Ising model was first proposed by Wilhelm Lenz who gave it as a problem to his graduate student Ernst Ising, after whom this model is named. The 1-D model was solved by Ising in his 1924 thesis. Later, in 1944 Lars Onsager solved the 2-D model with the transfer matrix approach$^\\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model/}{ [Wikipedia]}$.  It is powerful in modelling many thermodynamical phenomena and in explaining phase transitions and universality$^\\href{https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-cartoon-picture-of-magnets-that-has-transformed-science-20200624/}{ [Q]}$.\n",

It is an alloy of magnetic impurities diluted in a nonmagnetic metal. At 0 K, the spin glass system attains a minimum energy configuration, called the ground state. This state can be found by minimizing the Hamiltonian associated with the system. The spin glass system, due to the intrinsic disorderness, is also related to several optimization problems. \n",

    "The Ising model is a good representation for the study of spin glasses. So, minimizing the Ising Hamiltonian (*introduced below*) gives the ground state (or low energy states) for spin glass systems. Thus, minimizing   is equivalent to the optimal solution for problems like the Max-Cut problem and the Travelling Salesperson problem.\n",
