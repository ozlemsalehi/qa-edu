    "Simulated annealing is a stochastic global search optimization algorithm.\n",

    "The algorithm is inspired by annealing in _metallurgy_ where metal is heated to a high temperature quickly, then cooled slowly. The physical annealing process works by first exciting the atoms in the material at a high temperature, allowing the atoms to move around a lot, then decreasing their excitement slowly, allowing the atoms to fall into a new, more stable configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simulated annealing (SA) mimics the physical annealing process. (We would like to point out that it is not a physical process but it is an anology). It can be considered as a modified version of stochastic hill climbing. Stochastic hill climbing maintains a single candidate solution and takes steps of a random but constrained size from the candidate in the search space. If the new point is better than the current point, then the current point is replaced with the new point. This process continues for a fixed number of iterations."

    "Simulated annealing executes the search in the same way. The main difference is that new points that are not as good as the current point (worse points) are accepted sometimes. A worse point is accepted probabilistically where the likelihood of accepting a solution worse than the current solution is a function of the _temperature_ of the search and how much worse the solution is than the current solution. Moving to worse solutions allow escaping from local minima. The temperature is decreased gradually, making unfavorable changes less probable as the process continues. 0 temperature is simply the hill climbing algorithm.  "
