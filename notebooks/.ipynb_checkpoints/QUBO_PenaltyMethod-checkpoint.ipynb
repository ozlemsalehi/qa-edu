    "Penalty Method solves a constrained optimization problem using a certain class of algorithms by replacing it with a series of unconstrained problems whose solutions approximate the solution of the original constrained optimization problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create the related unconstrained problems, a **penalty function** is added to the original objective function. The penalties are chosen such that the effects of constraints can be included in the final optimal solution. Penalty function includes a penalty parameter multiplied by a measure of violation of the constraints. The measure of violation is zero in the region where constraints are not violated; non-zero otherwise. Thus, the penalties are formulated so that they equal zero for feasible solutions; non-zero for infeasible solutions. \n",
