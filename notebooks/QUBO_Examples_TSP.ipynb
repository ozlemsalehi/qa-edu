    "Recall, given a set of cities and corresponding distances between each pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route such that a salesman visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point / hometown. So, eventually, the salesman maximizes his sales by minimizng the total cost of travelling between the nodes. \n",

    "#### Hamiltonian Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "A path through a graph that visits each node (city) exactly once is called a Hamiltonian path or a **Hamiltonian cycle**. To define the mathematical formulation, the problem asks for the shortest Hamiltonian cycle that can be taken through each of the nodes. So, we will find the shortest Hamiltonian cycle in a graph $G = (V,E)$ with N nodes and costs $w_{ij}$ (cost of travelling from node $i$ to node $j$). Here $V =\\{1,...N\\}$ is the set of nodes and E is the edge set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cycle is defined using $N^2$ binary variables $x_{i,p}$, where $i$ represents the node and $p$ represents the order in that cycle. The variable results in 1 if salesman passes node $i$ if its at position $p$ in the route.\n",
