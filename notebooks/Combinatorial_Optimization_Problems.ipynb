    "Combinatorial Optimization is concerned with finding an optimal or close to optimal solution among a finite collection of possibilities. From a computer science perspective, combinatorial optimization seeks to improve an algorithm by using mathematical methods either to reduce the size of the set of possible solutions or to make the search itself faster. They are employed in the navigation system in cars, the software used to create timetables for high schools, decision support systems in production and logistic environments, determining the optimal way to deliver packages etc. since, in many such problems, exhaustive search is not tractable. Now we'll proceed with some examples of combinatorial optimization problems. "
