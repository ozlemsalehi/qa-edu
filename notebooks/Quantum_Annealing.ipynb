Although finding the lowest energy state might be NP-Hard, quantum adiabatic theorem offers a new approach for solving the problem."

    "$H_I$ is the initial Hamiltonian and $H_F$ is the final Hamiltonian. $s(t)$ decreases from 1 to 0, so that at the end of the procedure we have $H(t) = H_F$. Hence if we start with a Hamiltonian whose ground state is easy to prepare and evolve the system according to the above rules, then the system will end up with the ground state of Hamiltonian $H_F$. This gives the idea of picking $H_F$ as the Hamiltonian whose ground state is the solution we are looking for. "
