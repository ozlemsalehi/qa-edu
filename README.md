# QWorld Introductory Tutorial for Quantum Annealing

Most of this tutorial is developed during [QIntern 2021](https://qworld.net/qintern-2021/) organized by [QWorld](https://qworld.net/) under the project "Educational material development for quantum annealing". We would like to thank the organizers for this event.

The project is lead by [Dr.Özlem Salehi Köken](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~ozlem.salehi/). The notebooks are created by [Akash Narayanan B](https://gitlab.com/AkashNarayanan), [Paul Joseph Robin](https://gitlab.com/pjr1363), [Sabah Ud Din Ahmad](https://gitlab.com/sabahuddin.ahmad), [Sourabh Nutakki](https://gitlab.com/Sourabh499). [Manan Sood](https://gitlab.com/Manan-Sood) contributed to one notebook.

### Prerequisite

The prerequisites are basic knowledge on matrices, some experience with Python and preferably some knowledge on what basic quantum computing. 

### Using Binder  

You may [![launch binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/qa-edu/HEAD?labpath=index.ipynb) to view the material without any installation.
